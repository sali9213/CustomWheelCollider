This project contains a custom wheel collider implementation with 2 major components, the suspension and tires. The defauly Unity wheel collider provides adequate depth for simplistic driving, but for something more realistic it usually isnt the best. This wheel collider implementation aims to provide something that can be more realistic. Its configurability allows it to be tweaked to provide different types of driving dynamics. It uses the pacejka tire model to calculate longitudinal and lateral tire forces.
